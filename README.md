# Random Quote Machine

This is my solution to freeCodeCamp's random quote machine zipline.

## Known Issues
A mixed content error arises due to the requesting of an HTTP resource over a HTTPS connection. This happens if the application is hosted on a service that makes use of HTTPS.

However, the application can be ran locally by following the steps below:
1. Clone the repository/ download and extract the project's zip file
2. Run the index.html file in a web browser
