# Random Quote Machine

This is my solution to freeCodeCamp's random quote machine zipline.

## Known Issues
A mixed content error arises in Google Chrome, and Firefox if the application is accessed over an HTTPS connection. This happens because the application is pulling its information (quotes) from an HTTP resource which is consided unsecured content. See [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/MixedContent]

The application can be ran by ensuring that the application is loaded over the HTTP protocol. Therefore, the application can be accessed via http://oharrison.github.io/random-quote-machine

Additionally, the application can be ran locally by following the steps below:
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository/ download and extract the project's zip file</li>
  <li>Run the index.html file in a web browser</li>
</ol>
