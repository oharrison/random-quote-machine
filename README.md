# Random Quote Machine

This is my solution to freeCodeCamp's random quote machine zipline.

## Known Issues
A mixed content error arises due to the requesting of an HTTP resource over a HTTPS connection. This happens if the application is hosted on a service that makes use of HTTPS. See [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/MixedContent]

However, the application can be ran locally by following the steps below:
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository/ download and extract the project's zip file</li>
  <li>Run the index.html file in a web browser</li>
</ol>
